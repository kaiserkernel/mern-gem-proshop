# Bug Fixes, corrections and code FAQ

The code here in the main branch has been updated since the course was published to fix bugs found by students of the course and answer common questions, if you are looking to compare your code to that from the course lessons then
please refer to the [originalcoursecode](https://github.com/bradtraversy/proshop-v2/tree/originalCourseCode) branch of this repository.

There are detailed notes in the comments that will hopefully help you understand
and adopt the changes and corrections.
An easy way of seeing all the changes and fixes is to use a note highlighter
extension such as [This one for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) or [this one for Vim](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim) Where by you can easily list all the **NOTE:** and **FIX:** tags in the comments.

### BUG: Warnings on ProfileScreen

We see the following warning in the browser console..

`<tD> cannot appear as a child of <tr>.`

and

`warning: Received 'true' for a non-boolean attribute table.`

> Code changes can be seen in [ProfileScreen.jsx](./frontend/src/screens/ProfileScreen.jsx)

### BUG: Changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled

In our SearchBox input, it's possible that our `urlKeyword` is **undefined**, in
which case our initial state will be **undefined** and we will have an
uncontrolled input initially i.e. not bound to state.
In the case of `urlKeyword` being **undefined** we can set state to an empty
string.

> Code changes can be seen in [SearchBox.jsx](./frontend/src/components/SearchBox.jsx)

### Bug: All file types are allowed when updating product images

When updating and uploading product images as an Admin user, all file types are allowed. We only want to upload image files. This is fixed by using a fileFilter function and sending back an appropriate error when the wrong file type is uploaded.

You may see that our `checkFileType` function is declared but never actually
used, this change fixes that. The function has been renamed to `fileFilter` and
passed to the instance of [ multer ](https://github.com/expressjs/multer#filefilter)

> Code changes can be seen in [uploadRoutes.js](./backend/routes/uploadRoutes.js)
